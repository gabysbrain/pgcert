# Portfolios

## P1

* Labs let students learn practical skills while being able to ask questions
* Exams test facts
* Coursework is often constrained by the specification
* What's really important is how students can synthesize knowledge and showing
  independent work and interest

## P2

* How can students get jobs later? 
* Portfolios show individual work 
* Give room for creative freedom
* Show application of principles taught in class
* Evaluation can probably be done between students (I've heard)
