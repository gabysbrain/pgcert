I try to encourage students in the modules I teach to be creative and I want
students to understand both theory and practice of the subject so that they
will be more "future proofed" to changes in technology. To accomplish this I
want to integrate a portfolio-style assessment[ref] into my modules.  I think
the project portfolio assessment method will make an interesting next step in
making better assignments.  Students will be encouraged to be creative while
demonstrating that they've learned the concepts for the assignment.

To reflect on my ideas with regards to assessment methods, I will be using
Kolb's experiential learning model[ref]. I used this model because I have been
evaluating assessment methods for a while now. The cyclical nature of Kolb's
model fits better with a series of reflection and action on a particular topic.
Single pass models like that of Borton's model of reflection[ref] are more
suited for more specific reflection or newer ideas.

In order to understand the reasoning and personal issues with some other
methods I have tried, I will first talk about my experiences with other
assessment methods. This will give context to my choice of portfolio assessment
methods.

The first *concrete experience* with assessment began with a visualization
module that I was teaching. One coursework for the module was an individual
programming exercise where the students were given a specification (i.e. a list
of features) to implement. The assignment also included a rubric describing 
how many points each feature is worth. 

After a few times giving the same assignment, I became more and more unhappy
with the submissions. The students were accomplishing the assignment but not
much learning seemed to be taking place.  Upon *reflective observation* of the
situation I noticed a great deal of similarity between the student assignments.
With few exceptions, students could replicate the instructions in the tutorial
but not go any further.  This was confirmed by talking to the students.  They
were mostly copying from online tutorials without trying to understand the
copied code. Furthermore, they weren't synthesizing the information. I was
quite uncomfortable with the assignment as is. Furthermore, the assignment was
quite boring to mark since all assignments were so similar. What I wanted was
some way to encourage creativity while accomplishing the assignment.

Before changing the assignment I considered what I want students to learn in my
modules. This is the *abstract conceptualization* step of Kolb's model.  I
reflected on what I felt are important skills for students to take into the
real world. I based this on both the pedagogical goals of computer science
and my own experiences from working in industry. Computer science is an applied
field. Much of computer science education is teaching current programming
languages and techniques that can be directly applied in industry. However,
there is also a large theoretical component with the idea that this will make
students more adaptable to inevitable changes in technologies[ref]. In industry
soft skills and developing creative solutions to problems are also vital. 

Therefore, there are three aspects to every module that I want students to learn:
ability to explain their work, showing creative freedom, and synthesizing 
concepts in the module. Being able to communicate their contributions, both how
and why they are important, is a vital skill in the job market. Creativity is
also a much-valued skill in the technology world and that should be encouraged
within modules as well. Creativity should not be overly constrained by the 
specification in the assignment. Finally, I want the students to demonstrate
that they are not only able to repeat concepts in the module but that they
have internalized concepts. This is important because technologies change 
rapidly. A popular programming language or framework today may not be in active
use in five years time. The theory and concepts do not change as fast so a firm
understanding of these concepts will help students to be more adaptable to changes
in the future.


These goals match with the 'synthesize' aspect of Bloom's taxonomy[ref].
Learning objectives were easy to specify what I wanted students to demonstrate.
There was a disconnect between the ways of accomplishing the specification
versus what the students were learning.

Based on this, I created an experiment for the next time I taught the module
(*active experimentation*). I changed the assignment to give a general problem
description and dataset along with a new rubric for the main programming
assignment. Rather than using features as the basis of evaluation, I developed
a hierarchy of learning objective-based marks. 
Students could accomplish the 
assignment however they saw fit and just had to demonstrate that they had 
learned the concepts for the assignment. 
The idea of this type of assignment was to encourage creativity in 
accomplishing the assignment. My hope was also to avoid submissions where code
was copy-pasted from tutorials without any understanding.

In order to get the students started I provided a sample image of the final
tool and some guidelines on how to start. However, I reiterated in the
assignment that students could accomplish it however they liked. I also asked
for feedback on this new type of assignment.

While students worked on the assignment I received many questions about how 
they should get started. The questions centered around the fact that the 
assignment and rubric did not give a clear specification for the assignment.
These did not happen in the original version of the
assignment. Furthermore, the difficulty of the open-ended assignment resulted
in students simply implementing the sample version. 

I used another round of *reflective observation* of the assignment, this time
using the new version, to figure out the source of student difficulty.
It was clear that the difficulty of the assignment wording was discouraging
creativity. Furthermore, it was not clear that the students were internalizing
the concepts.

My *abstract conceptualization* of the problem is that students are not
familiar with more open-ended assignments. This is understandable. In other
modules, students are given a fairly rigid specification with a defined list of
features. Assessment is based on how many of these features are present and
functional. The previous version of the assignment also did not develop any 
soft skills. 
For my next revision of this assignment I will take into account
the student expectations while trying to accomplish my goals.

My idea going forward is moving to using portfolios[ref] method in my modules.
Portfolios seem to have a number of advantages over a single assignment.  They
encourage individuality. Each student is encouraged to develop a distinctive
portfolio. Students can use the portfolio as part of their job interview
process.  Many technology companies want to see samples of what sorts of
projects applicants have done and how they accomplished them. Portfolios
provide these samples. They also allow the students to show individual work,
allowing students to distinguish themselves and encourages creative freedom. 

I will split up a coursework into several smaller assessments which would form
a portfolio. Perhaps I can integrate the coursework with the practical lab
sessions in the module. By breaking up the assignment into smaller parts I
hope to encourage experimentation. The first smaller assignment can also be 
used to get the students used to the different specification and rubric.
In addition the portfolio will give the students an opportunity to get early
feedback. From a lecturing standpoint, this will give me the chance to see
if students are falling behind. Then, steps can be taken to catch up the 
student. Furthermore, the portfolio structure allows for rewarding of extra
work. This can either be done for students who are falling behind or for
exceptional students to progress further. I can also adjust the mark based
on improvement during the semester. Finally, a reflective assignment will help
the students to develop soft skills of explaining what they've done and why.

One issue with this assessment method is that it might encourage too much
individualism. Learning how to work in a group is an important skill but the
portfolio method seems to encourage individualism. A vital skill in the
technology world is learning to integrate one's own individual ideas with
others in the group. I also worry that students who are better at "marketing"
their contributions may trump technical ability. While soft skills are important
they should not a replacement for technical skill. 

The biggest issue with portfolio assessment is that evaluation is quite
expensive in terms of time. Each assignment will be unique so scaling this
assessment method to fifty or 100 students may not be possible. Typical
solutions to having many students is to simplify the assessment (e.g. multiple
choice questions) or use an automatic code checking system. The problem with
these is they require a rigid assignment specification which does not allow
creative solutions. Two solutions I have been considering is using peer 
marking[ref]. With peer marking it is not clear to me of the quality of 
marking especially in terms of feedback with more open-ended assignments. My
other idea is to have a short question and answer section and mark mostly on
that but then technical ability will be de-emphasized. Without a clear
way to handle this it will be difficult to create the next experiment and see
how well the portfolio assessment method works in practice in my modules.
