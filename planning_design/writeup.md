I have been teaching data visualization in a number of different contexts.  One
of the things I have observed which is lacking is the ability to reason about
different conflicting objectives when designing visualizations. Often students
use defaults or the most common method without considering if these are
appropriate choices. I think much of this has to do with the primary focus of
Computer Science education using engineering principles. Therefore,
incorporating ideas from design education will help students to make more
reasoned decisions about tradeoffs in visualization design.

Computer Science has strong traditions from both mathematics and engineering.
The curriculum also reflects this. Many subjects involve learning rigorous
mathematical proofs and engineering best practices. This works well because
many subjects deal with computers which are deterministic and all operate in a
similar way. One of the key aspects of data visualization, however, is the
man/machine interface to help users better understand their
data[@munzner:2014].  While visualization has aspects of engineering and
mathematical principles (e.g. the data visualization pipeline[@heer:2005]),
much of the human-interface aspect is a set of guidelines --- humans are much
more variable than computers. Many of the guidelines will work for some groups
and not others and often conflict with each other. Tradeoffs need to be made.
Students taking a data visualization module should understand how and when to
apply those guidelines. Sometimes sacrifices in principles need to be made to
give more weight to other principles. From my experience, this seems to be one
of the more difficult aspects for Computer Science students to learn. They need
more practice with reasoning evaluation, and reflection of the guidelines.

My idea to address this is to incorporate pedagogical ideas from graphic
design[@heller:2015]. Students in design programs are
tasked with creating artefacts for humans given a certain set of criteria. This
is very much in line with the goals of designing a visualization. In design
programs, students focus on coming up with a design based on various criteria,
reflect on it, evaluate the pros and cons, and then make an improved version. 
I will incorporate this teaching method into my visualization module. Students
will be given a dataset and requirements and asked to design a visualization.
I will also incorporate an evaluation component to the courseworks where the
students will be asked to sketch an improved design based on feedback.

To incorporate these ideas I will need to make a number of adaptions to the
standard design education assignment structure.  During the semester there will
be multiple courseworks thus giving students an opportunity to apply feedback
on their evaluations and improve.  The basis of each coursework will be to
produce a visualization using proper design principles discussed in class.
Students must explain what design principles were taken into account, likely
using the ideas of literate visualization[@wood:2018].  Then, each student will
perform peer marking[@chen:2015;sadler:2016] on a random set of submission and
each submission will be marked by several students, these will give students
practice on evaluating visualization designs.  I will look over the evaluations
and give feedback. This will form part of the mark.  Courseworks will not build
on each other so missing one or turning it in late will not put students
behind.  What will build will be the evaluations. Improvement in evaluation
will be incorporated into the final mark. Learning from earlier mistakes will
also be important.

Experience with the design process will give students invaluable experience in
learning to balance multiple conflicting objectives and iterative design
processes.  I also hope this will be more engaging for the students throughout
the semester.
