abstract = {Including software testing practices in programming assignments has moved from a novel idea to accepted practice in recent years. Further, testing frameworks have spurred renewed interest in new approaches to automated grading, with some systems specifically aiming to give feedback on software testing skills. As more educators consider incorporating testing techniques in their own courses, lessons learned from using testing in the classroom as well as from using automated grading systems become more valuable. This paper summarizes experiences in using software testing in CS1- and CS2-level courses over the past three years. Among these experiences, this paper focuses on student perceptions of automated grading tools and how they might be addressed, approaches to designing project specifications, and strategies for providing meaningful feedback to students that can help improve their performance and reduce their frustration.},
