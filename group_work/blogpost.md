One thing that I found really interesting from the discussion is the different
experiences of group work. I can see a bit of a pattern within the different
disciplines. Differences in experience seem to vary across disciplines. For
example, math and computer science (Blanchard, Vaidhiyanathan) have concerns
about individual assessment within the group project. It seems that other
disciplines use group work to replicate real-world scenarios (Celik, Davies) or
for debating issues (Pak).  Personally, I've had mixed experiences with group
work so it was interesting reading about the different experiences. 

One of the things I would have found very helpful in the literature is a bit
more critical discussion of experiences implementing group work. I understand
that it's difficult to publish negative scientific studies but it would be
invaluable for those implementing group work. The issues I've seen are fairly
cursory. I would have also liked a bit more discussion of taxonomy. The idea
of group work is quite broad. There are everything from pair, in-class
discussions to large term projects with 5-10 people. I haven't seen this
organized into some sort of review. Papers seem to be written as a single case
study without much abstraction to the larger taxonomy around group work. This
makes it hard to understand how transferrable techniques will be to my own
teaching without trying it myself. This isn't always easy when teaching due to
time constraints and addressing the needs of the students.
